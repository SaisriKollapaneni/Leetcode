# 🧩 LeetCode Patterns Practice

This repository is my personal space to practice and master LeetCode problems by organizing them into patterns.  
The idea is simple — instead of solving problems randomly, I focus on one pattern at a time, understand its core concepts, and then solve all related problems.

## 📂 Structure

The repository is organized by patterns.  
Each pattern has its own folder containing:
- **Solutions** – Clean, well-structured code (mostly in python, but may include other languages)
- **README.md** – Explanation of the pattern, problem list, and detailed reasoning for each solution

## 🎯 Goal

1. **Pattern-based learning** – Group similar problems to recognize common strategies.
2. **Deep understanding** – Write clear explanations in the pattern README to reinforce concepts.
3. **Consistency** – Solve problems daily/weekly until all major patterns are covered.
4. **Reusable knowledge** – Build a personal reference guide for coding interviews.

## ✏️ Learning Philosophy

1. Solve → Understand → Explain → Repeat.
2. Quality over quantity — I focus on why a solution works, not just how to code it.
3. Mistakes are part of the process — I record them so I don’t repeat them.

## 🤝 Contributions

This is primarily my personal learning log, but if you have suggestions or better solutions, feel free to open a pull request or share ideas in the Issues section.
